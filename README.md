## Introduction

The site is created in 2023 to demonstrate the knowledge of programming languages taught in the course, for about a month the development was done iterating on the requirements to finally have this final product.

We sought to project the image of an agile, modern bank, interested in providing a solution to its customers. Relevant content was developed within the concept of the bank and the style should reflect the conceptualization understood. To this end, a color palette and bank logos were developed, and the solution was implemented along these lines.


## Features

- Navigation bar:** A navigation bar is available to move within the website with working links.
- Carousel:** Customer can see through carousel the relevant information for their knowledge and access link is enabled.
- Account creation:** The user can create his account by filling out the form, which will validate if all fields are filled in, if the email is valid, if the password meets the criteria of more than 8 characters, if the password confirmation meets the criteria of more than 8 characters in length, and if the password confirmation is equal to the password, as well as the acceptance of terms and conditions and is registered in the database via API.
- Account login:** Customer can login by filling in registered username and password, the system checks in the database if it finds the record, and if yes, then directs you to the "Account" page where you can see your email on the top right and your name in the greeting. 
- Deposit:** Client can deposit money and it is reflected in the "Available Balance" field. It is validated that the value corresponds to a number, that it does not correspond to a negative number and then the corresponding value is added and updated.
- Withdrawal:** Client may withdraw money from the amount reflected in the "Available Balance" field. It is validated that the value does not exceed the available amount, that it does not correspond to a negative number and that the corresponding value is then subtracted and updated.
- When the user logs in, he/she can see all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) made to date.
